<h1>Unique Web User Registration System 🔐 </h1>
Built a full-stack web app using the MERN stack. This app allowed web users to securely register for a website while providing basic authentication features like duplicate user prevention. Initialised a React App, connected it with a custom Node.JS Server, and created a MongoDB database using mongoose to privately store user JSON data.

Both server-side and client-side code provided.
